## Installation

To get started with it, simply clone the repository and run the following commands:

```bash
php ocl oph install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies and set up your project. You can then start building your application using the provided components and utilities.

## Usage

You can check out the [the full tutorial here](https://ophose.ah4.fr/docs). But, here's a quick example to get you started: 

```javascript
class YourComponent extends Ophose.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }

    handleClick() {
        alert('You clicked the button!');
    }

    render() {
        return _('div',
            _('h1', 'Hello, World!'),
            _('p', 'This is a simple example of using Ophose.'),
            _('button', { onClick: this.handleClick }, 'Click me')
        ),
    }
}
```

This will create a simple component that renders a heading, a paragraph, and a button. When the button is clicked, it will display an alert with the message "You clicked the button!".
